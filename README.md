The project was built to allow several real-life blog situations, such as:
* Check all posts
* Register as a new user
* Login and logout
* Comment on existing posts (logged users only)
* Edit a post (Admin Only)
* Create a new post (Admin Only)
* Delete a post (Admin Only)

## Disclaimer

This is a blog project from the 100 Days of Code course in Udemy. https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

As the objective of the project is creating a site that explores usernames and databases, most of the templates and aesthetics weren't edited.

## Important
If you have any doubts, please visit the code as it is very well documented. Besides that, feel free to contact me, it will be a pleasure to talk and learn with you! I'm also available for helping in your own projects!
